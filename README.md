# Aphelion

Aphelion is a web app made for a school project. The purpose of the app was to explore and gain a better understanding of web backend development. The web app is centered around a simple game concept. Essentially it works as reverse pong where you try you're hardest to not let the ball hit you. However, the game is really just there to have an objective for the backend which includes..

- Encrypted communication using socket.io and nginx.
- A login system, using bcrypt for storing passwords.
- A leaderboard system a database hosted with mongodb atlas.
- An account system using mongodb and gravatar to display personal information (provided it's been provided).
- Nice global graphics and music to enrich the whole experience (music togglable of course).

Enjoy!
